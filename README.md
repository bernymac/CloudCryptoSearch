# CloudCryptoSearch
CloudCryptoSearch is a searchable encryption middleware. It can be used to store, update, and search (through multiple keywords and returning ranked results)  encrypted text documents in a remote server or computational cloud. Both the privacy of the text documents and of the queries is guaranteed by the middleware.
